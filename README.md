# SplitFree Backend

SplitFree is a backend service designed to manage expense splitting among groups of people. It provides APIs to handle user accounts, groups, expenses, and settlements.

## ðŸ“Œ Why I Built This

I got fed up with using the ad-heavy Splitwise app and wanted a clean, simple, ad-free alternative to split expenses with friends. So I built **SplitFree** to scratch my own itch â€” and it turned out way too fun to stop.

# Live URLS:
- Backend: [splitfree(onrender)](https://splitfree-backend.onrender.com/)
- Frontend: [splitfree(Vercel)](https://split-free-frontend.vercel.app/)

Note: Both backend and frontend is deployed in free tier service, so it may take time to load
## Features

- Seamlessly log in using your Google account for a secure and hassle-free authentication experience.
- Create groups, share invite URLs, and let others join easily through a shared link.
- Add, track, and manage shared expenses within groups â€” automatically calculate individual shares.
- Maintain a chronological log of all activities and changes made within each group for complete transparency.
- Automatically compute who owes whom and optimize settlements to minimize the number of transactions required.
- Clean, consistent, and well-structured API endpoints designed following REST best practices.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.envrc.local`(if using direnv) file in the project root and add the following:

```
    export USE_SQLITE=true # I use it for local development
    export DATABASE_URL=<url>
    export FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS=xx-xx-xxx.json # If using firebase creds json file put file name location here
    export FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_B64='xxxxxx-xxxx' # If using base64 encrypted creds then put its value here
```
Note:
- Make sure to run direnv allow, if there is any changes in this file
